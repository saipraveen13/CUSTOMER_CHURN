# Customer Churn Prediction (End-to-End Project)

This is a **basic end-to-end Data Science project** where we build, train, and deploy a **Customer Churn Prediction Model**.  
The model predicts whether a customer is likely to **churn (leave the company)** or **stay**, based on customer attributes like tenure, services, charges, and payment method.

The project is deployed using **Flask**, with a **frontend built in HTML + CSS**, and the prediction is shown dynamically on the same page with animations.


## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing & Training**
   - Dataset: `Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`
   - Encoded categorical features using `LabelEncoder`
   - Trained a **Logistic Regression** model
   - Saved model (`churn_model.pkl`), encoders (`encoders.pkl`), and feature order (`feature_order.pkl`)

2. **Flask Backend (`app.py`)**
   - Loads trained model and encoders
   - Accepts user inputs from form
   - Makes predictions and returns probability of churn

3. **Frontend (HTML + CSS)**
   - User-friendly input form (`index.html`)
   - Modern styling with `style.css`
   - Loader animation while predicting
   - Prediction result with fade-in effect
